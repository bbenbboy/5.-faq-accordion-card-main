## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Relearned forEach()

```js
faqClick.forEach((faq) => {
  faq.addEventListener("click", function () {
    faq.classList.toggle("active");
  });
});
```

### Continued development

I think too much about forEach() so I made to many classes.
